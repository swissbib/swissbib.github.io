## The past 

Alphabetic browse indices were very popular in OPAC based on integrated library systems like Aleph 500.
They were mainly used by expert users or library staff and were an outstanding feature in specialists catalogs like the one for "Handschriften, Archive und Nachlässe" (manuscripts, archives and estates) - the predecessor of www.swisscollections.ch.

The swissbib project team was frequently confronted with requests for an alphabetical browse index in the discovery system swissbib.ch. Mainly because of time restrictions of a small development team and regular controversial discussions in the library community about the sense and purpose of an alphabetical index the decision for concrete development steps were regularly postponed.
Even commercial providers of the then new search engine based discovery system didn't provide a solution for this request of their customers. We think: the main reason for this behaviour was that all the by then provided components for alphabetic browse indices were based relational database solutions as the core component of an integral library system.
It wasn't so easy to implement the same functionality based on search engine technolgy. 

ein paar Gründe warum dies so ist

Now, where most of the traditional Webopacs are migrated to commercial discovery solutions like Primo it isn't so easy to find a still public accesible alphabetic browse feature.
