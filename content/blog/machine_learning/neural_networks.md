Besides the availability of data, one additional reason why Machine Learning has become a popular topic has to do with publicly available libraries that simplify the implementation of machines. One such library has been <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=en', target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>, an open-source platform written by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain', target="_blank">Google Brain</a>. TensorFlow can be used when implementing Neural Networks. Since end of 2019 a library called <a href='https://keras.io/', target="_blank">keras</a> has been integrated on top of TensorFlow. This library makes the code implementation of Neural Networks even easier. The swissbib project at hand is probably the first implementation of a Neural Network for deduplication based on keras. This blog article explains Neural Networks and compares the results of its implementation with the results of the preceding blog articles.





The <a href='/blog/machine_learning/support_vector_machines' target="_blank">second blog article</a> makes some statements about the human brain at its end.
